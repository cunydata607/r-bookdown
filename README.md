# r-bookdown

CUNY Data 607 Spring 2018 Project

## Project Outline

Using data from the fivethirtyeight Web site (http://fivethirtyeight.com/), our class will develop tutorials to demonstrate the capabilities of the functions in the tidyverse package for R.

Each class member is expected to contribute an example to the final project, which will be compiled in an R bookdown format.  Although each student is expected to prepare a tutorial for a specific function, collaboration on the overall project is encouraged and allowed.

The student body as a whole will be responsible for the organization and content of the project, collaborating in an unsupervised manner to self-determine the best presentation of the final product.
